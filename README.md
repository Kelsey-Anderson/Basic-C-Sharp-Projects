### Car Insurance
This project is MVC web application that mimics a car insurance quote program. The user can input details and the program will calculate a quote. 
The Admin page is where all input quotes can be viewed and managed.

### Shipping Quote
This is a console application that calculates shipping costs based on simple weights/dimensions logic.

### Exception Handling
This is a console application assignment where I practiced exception handling using a simple math program.

### Try/Catch Exceptions
This is a console application demonstrating some more Try/Catch and exception handling practice. 

### Calling Methods
This is a console application uses simple math logic to demonstrate calling methods into a program.

### Days of the Week
